# Assignments Using API's Week 1

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Prep exercises
3. Assignments exercises
4. Career Training 1 (If not completed yet)

## **1. Practice the concepts**

This week is tough, asynchronous coding is another one of these programming things that takes awhile to get your head around. Let's start this week off with some interactive exercises! Visit the following link to get started:

- [Visualising Asynchronicity](https://www.jsv9000.app/). _Note that you do not need to actually solve anything here, but you can use this visualizer to see how asynchronicity works under the hood. Very cool!_
- [Learn JavaScript: Promises](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-intermediate-javascript/lessons/promises/exercises/constructing-promises). _Note that the last exercise is not necessary, it is very complicated and something that is rarely used. You will not need to be able to do this. See it as a challenge!_
- [JavaScript promises, mastering the asynchronous](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/347/javascript-promises-mastering-the-asynchronous/what-is-asynchronous-in-javascript)

## **2. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your class and your Q&A mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `Using API's` fork, go to the folder `Week1`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **3. Assignments exercises**

This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (Using API's / Week 1). Have a look at the [assignments guide](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs/blob/main/hand-in-assignments-guide.md) to see how to hand in your assignments.

*NOTE: do NOT forget to checkout the main branch before creating the branch for this week. Otherwise your previous assignments will be a part of the PR*

## **4. Career Training 1 (If not completed yet)**

Remember that the Career Training 1 session is coming up (check your class channel on slack for the exact date). Before the session make sure you have:

- Read the whole [personal brand repository](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand).
- Done the [assignments](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand/blob/main/yourcurriculum.md#4-submitting-your-cv-to-the-hyf-team) for the repository.

## Done early?

Have a look at the material for next week!
